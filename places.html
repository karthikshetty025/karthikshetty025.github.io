                                                of Malpe in Udupi, Karnataka, India. They are known for their distinctive geological formation of columnar basaltic lava.Scientific studies indicate that the basalt of the St. Mary's Islands was formed by sub-aerial subvolcanic activity, because at that time Madagascar was attached to India. The rifting of Madagascar took place around 88 million years ago.The islands form one of the four geological monuments in Karnataka state, one of the 26 Geological Monuments of India declared by the Geological Survey of India in 2001. The monument is considered an important site for "Geo Tourism".

At the last spiral there is a room where there are wooden steps, it's more like a ladder to be precise where you will have to snug yourself thru and arrive at the balcony of the Light house.
