                                                Yakshagana  is a traditional theatre form that combines dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques with a unique style and form.Yakshagana is traditionally presented from dusk to dawn. Its stories are drawn from Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata and other epics from both Hindu and Jain traditions.Yakshagana literally means the song (gana) of the yaksha (nature spirits). It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music.Yakshagana was first introduced in Udupi by Madhvacharya's disciple Naraharitirtha.A typical Yakshagana performance consists of background music played by a group of musicians (known as the himmela) and a dance and dialog group (known as the mummela), who together enact poetic epics on stage. The himmela is made up of a lead singer (bhagawata)—who also directs the production.

                                                  Buta Kola is a ritual folk dance from the coastal districts (Tulu Nadu) of Karnataka, India. The dance is highly stylized and held in honor of the local deities worshiped by the Tulu speaking population. It bears resemblance to the Theyyam of Kerala and has influenced Yakshagana folk theatre. Buta Kola could be categorized as a form of Shamanism as the dancer performing it goes into a trance and acts as an oracle for the deity being impersonated.A būta kōla or nema is typically an annual ritual performance where local spirits or deities (būtas, daivas) are being impersonated by ritual specialists from certain scheduled castes such as the Nalike, Pambada, or Parawa communities.

                                                  A kambala  is an annual buffalo race held in the southwestern Indian state of Karnataka. Traditionally, it is sponsored by local Tuluva landlords and households in the coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, a region collectively known as Tulu Nadu.The kambla season generally starts in November and lasts until March. The kambala racetrack is a slushy paddy field,and the buffaloes are driven by a whip-lashing farmer.Traditional kambala was non-competitive, and the pair was run one by one. In modern kambala, the contest generally takes place between two pair of buffaloes.
